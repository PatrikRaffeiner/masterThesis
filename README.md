Accompanying code for the master thesis written at the MCI in the study program Medichal Technologies.

Content:
- Generation of primitives at various positions and orientations via PIL 
- Calculation of Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to match the input of the DeepCFD network via snowy
- Meshing of primitives and definition of boundary conditions via pygmsh/gmsh
- Interpolation of of Ux, Uy, and p from an unstructured mesh into structured grid with recess of the primitive shape
